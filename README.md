# Web form with conditions

**Note:** please first read the exercise and ask for clarifications if you spot anything that is unclear.

**Subject:** create a validation mechanism for a web form containing fields with conditional dependencies.


## We need to collect some information about people

The information we want to gather is:
- Title (Mr, Mrs)
- First name
- Last name
- Country of citizenship (choices: France or Brazil only)
- Passport ID
- An email address


## Formatting / validation informations

The Passport ID looks different for Brazil and for France:
- Brazilian passport IDs contain 8 alphanumeric digits:
    - Two uppercase letters drawn from the set of unambiguous letters (see below)
    - Followed by 6 numerals (0-9)
- French passport IDs contain 9 alphanumeric digits (chosen from numerals 0â€“9 and the set of unambiguous letters).

The set of unambiguous letters is the following:
```
C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, R, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
```

The other fields should simply be not empty


## Goal

We provide you with a simple layout where everything is setup. However, the form is not operational as of now.

There are several levels of completion for this test :

### Level 1: Create a validation function for the form

In the codebase, we have the function `validateForm` which, for now, does absolutely nothing. Your work is to make sure that the "form submitted" message it
prints only appears when every input is valid.

### Level 2: Dynamic validation

In order to provide the user with a better UX, it would be very interesting to have the form inputs validation triggered upon change and to display error 
messages when relevant, so that the user knows on the spot if everything is correct or not. The implementation of this mechanism is up to you :)

### Level 3: Impress us !

Congratulations if you made it this far ! If you wish, feel free to do everything you think is interesting / relevant to improve the form : it can relate to
UI, UX, features, file structure, code quality or whatever you want to showcase :)
